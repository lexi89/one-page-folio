title: Ruby mini-apps

---
This page will document my progress towards Ruby on Rails mastery.

The purpose of this is to expose myself to as much Rails code as possible, practice research & planning, and documenting. As a by-product, I will create a portfolio of live mini-apps, be able to see how far I've come, and expose the bullshit monkey-mind insecurities that come up in the process.

# #1 — Twitter API practice

[Github link](https://github.com/lexi89/sandbox/tree/master/twitter_gem)

Goal: Connect to API with the [Twitter Gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter)

Find interesting tweets and write down the code snippets next to the results.

Ideas:

- The last 3 tweets about Trump.
- Funniest joke of the day (most retweeted / favourited?)
- Quote of the day (most retweeted / favourited?)
- Top 3 news stories in the UK
- Most retweeted thing in the whole of Twitter?

Style with Bootstrap & jQuery

Extras: Try using [livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) to improve workflow

# #2 — Admin CMS for a blog

[Github link](https://github.com/lexi89/sandbox/tree/master/Rails/blog_with_admin)


Goal: Simple CRUD blog to test out the [rails_admin gem](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin)

What I liked: Lots of functionality out of the box. Good starting point for simple projects that need a basic CMS
