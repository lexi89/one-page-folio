title: The "2 Rails Apps / Week" Journal

---
This page documents my progress towards Ruby on Rails mastery.

The purpose of this is to expose myself to as much Rails code as possible, practice research & planning, and documenting. As a by-product, I will create a portfolio of live mini-apps, be able to see how far I've come, and expose the bullshit monkey-mind insecurities that come up in the process.

The format of the exercise is this:

*Day 1*: Decide on a feature to explore. Document the plan and research.

*Day 2*: Build and deploy the demo app to Heroku.

*Day 3*: Document reflections and add demo-app to potfolio listing.
